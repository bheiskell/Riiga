Riiga Project Readme

More detail is needed in this readme before release. However in case someone
stumbles upon this project, this is a web forum designed for collaborative
fiction. It's very targeted for our specific usage however.

Some directories need to be writable by the webserver
$ cd app
$ sudo chgrp www-data db db/riiga.db tmp/*
$ chmod g+w db db/riiga.db tmp/*
